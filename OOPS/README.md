What is OOPS : 
I For understanding oops first lets see what we were doing in python for creating a program of addition we first use imperative approach.
-This approach is simple just use 2 variables and add them one problem with this is you have to make 2 other variables for adding 2 other numbers
-Next approach is using functions to add 2 numbers this is functional approach
-Here the good thing is we can add multiple numbers without using multiple variables.


Classes : 
A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.
Think of a class like the blueprint of a house. It defines what the house should have (rooms, windows, etc.) but doesnâ€™t build the house. An object is the actual house built using that blueprint.

Accessing attributes and methods : 
A class is initialised only one time when we first run the program. and for accessing the attributes and methods we have to first access the class and then attributes and methods.
